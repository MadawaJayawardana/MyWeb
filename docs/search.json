Welcome to my website!\nI’m an experienced applied statistician working as a Statistical Consultant for the Office of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Peter Mac), Melbourne, Australia. I’m also an Honorary Fellow at the University of Melbourne. At Peter Mac, I’m providing statistical support to cancer research staff via conducting workshops and consultations. Prior to joining Peter Mac, I was working as a lecturer in applied statistics at Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia. I have earned my PhD in Statistics from Macquarie University, Sydney. Further, I’ve studied and performed consultancy work at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA. Broader areas of research that I’m engaged in: biostatistics, statistical modelling, predictive modelling, change point analysis, epidemiology, data science, financial statistics, climate change statistical methods, physical health and ecological statistics.\n\n\n\n",

For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\n\nsummary(cars)\n\n\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n\nIncluding Plots\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n\n\n",
